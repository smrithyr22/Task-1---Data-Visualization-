## 📊 Population Distribution Visualization – Task 01

This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Task 01 initiative. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing gender-based population distribution in India over a four-year period using bar charts and histograms.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal is to visualize:
The total number of males and females in India (2020–2023)
The percentage of male and female population across the same years


## 🧾 Features

Merges 5 datasets: total, male, female, and gender percentages

Cleans and reshapes data using Pandas

Plots two types of bar charts:

Absolute Gender Count

Gender Percentage Distribution


## 📝 Task Description

Create bar charts or histograms to visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables. For this task, we focus on:

Gender-based distribution of India’s population (Total, Male, Female)

Percentage distribution of genders (Male % and Female %) from 2020 to 2023


## 📊 Visualizations Included

1. Bar Chart: Total number of males and females from 2020 to 2023


2. Bar Chart (Percentage): Gender percentage of total population (2020–2023)
   

## 📈 Sample Outputs

Visuals include:

📊 Gender-wise population bar chart

📊 Gender percentage distribution chart



## 🔑 Key Insights: Gender Distribution in India (2020–2023)

#### 1. Steady Population Growth:

The total population increased from 1.40 billion in 2020 to 1.44 billion in 2023.

Both male and female populations grew steadily year by year.

#### 2. Male Population Remains Higher:

Every year, the male population is consistently higher than the female population.

In 2023:

Male: 741.88 million

Female: 696.19 million

#### 3. Gender Gap is Narrowing Slightly:

Although males outnumber females, the gap is narrowly decreasing in terms of percentage.

Example:

2020: Males 51.63%, Females 48.37%

2023: Males 51.59%, Females 48.41%

#### 4. Balanced Gender Ratios (No Extremes):

Gender distribution remains relatively balanced, with fluctuations less than 0.05% annually.

Indicates demographic stability and consistency in gender ratio trends.

#### 5. Visual Confirmation:

Bar charts clearly show the gradual increase in both absolute numbers and a visually narrowing gender percentage gap over four years.
